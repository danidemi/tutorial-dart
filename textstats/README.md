# A DART based web app example

Every package has a pubspec, a file named pubspec.yaml, in the root directory of the package. That’s what makes it a package.

Once you’ve run pub get, pub upgrade, or pub downgrade on the package, you will also have a lockfile, named pubspec.lock.
If your package is an application package, this will be checked into source control. Otherwise, it won’t be.
